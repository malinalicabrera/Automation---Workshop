# Automation-Workshop - Wizeline Testing Days
Wizeline Assesment 1 (Front End TestCafe)
Instructions 

Create a new automation project from scratch with the framework/language you feel more comfortable with.
Automate the given scenarios for the sample page https://www.saucedemo.com/ provided:

Login with a valid-user
Expected: Validate the user navigates to the products page when logged in.
Add the specific product ‘Sauce Labs Onesie’ to the shopping cart
Expected: Validate the correct product was added to the cart.

Minimum Requirements
The project should be organized using Page Object Model (POM)
All test cases must contain at least one assertion. (Use Assertion Libraries)
Have meaningful validations, for example: when validating text, use the text content, not the message container, when validating existing elements, make sure it’s unique on the page.
Document instructions on how to run the project including the required libraries.
